### Projects I'm working on:
- [Messagin'](https://github.com/messagin) - An intuitive chat application designed for programmers and colaborators. Inspired by several platforms such as [Discord](https://discord.com), [Slack](https://slack.com), [Matrix](https://matrix.org) and [Revolt](https://revolt.chat).
- [Hadron](https://github.com/hadron-lang) - A programming language built on top of C. It will feature a compiler for low-level compatibility and an interpreter for high-level features.
- OS - Unfortunately I didn't come up with a name for this one yet. It's at very early stages of development and not published on github. I won't share any details for now :)
